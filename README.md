# Video_Conferences_App
Android application with real time activity like video meeting.
The video meeting will start using the Jitsi Meet.
To send a meeting invitation we will use firebase cloud messaging which is a 
cross-platform messaging solution that lets you reliably send messages at no cost. Using FCM, you can notify a client app that a new email or other data is 
available to sync.
